# jQuery Cookies

This is a small jQuery plugin for handling cookies. I wrote this because all
other cookie plugins I could find where either dead links or to limited for
my taste.

## Examples

```javascript
// get cookie
var name = $.cookie("name");
if (name === undefined) {
	console.log("cookie not set");
}
	
// set cookie
$.cookie("name","John Smith");

// get all cookies
var all_cookies = $.cookie();
if ("name" in all_cookies) {
	console.log(all_cookies.name);
}

// delete cookie
$.cookie("name",null);

// keep cookie for 2 days
$.cookie("name","John Smith",2);

// keep cookie until a certain date and restrict it to a certain path and domain
$.cookie("world","exists",new Date(2012,12-1,21),"/path","example.com");

// set/delete multiple cookies at once
$.cookie({
	name: "John Smith",
	occupation: null,
	age: {
		value: "30",
		expires: 365,
		secure: true
	}
});

// remove cookie and test wheter it was set:
if ($.removeCookie("name")) {
	console.log("name was set");
}
```
